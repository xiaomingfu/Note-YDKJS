#### Mixing (Up) "Class" Objects
##### Class Theory
###### "Claa" Design Pattern
Classes are just one of common design patterns. And class are an optional pattern in software design. 
###### JavaScript "Classes"
ES6 add `class` keyword. But JavaScript does not have classes. JS provides the illusion of classes.
###### Class Mechanics
In many class-oriented languages, the "standard library" provideds a "stack" data structure as a `Stack` class.

####### Building
A class is a blue-print. The end result of "construction" is an object, called an "instance".

####### Constructor
Constructor is a special method of the class to construct an instance of classes. This method is to initialize any information the instance will need.

####### Class Inheritance
In class-oriented languages, child class can inherit from parent class.

####### Polymorphism ???
Polymorphism(having different functions at multiple levels of an inheritance chain with the same name) may seem like it implies a referential relative link from child back to parent, but it is still a result of copy behavior.

The keyword `super` which leans on the idea that a "super class" is the parent of the current class. 

Another aspect of polymorphism is that a method name can have multiple definitions at different levels of the inheritant chain. 

**Class inheritance implies copies.**
